   <Address>1822 East Mall, Vancouver, BC</Address>
   <Lat>49.269041</Lat>
   <Long>-123.25319</Long>
   <Description>LEED Gold certification. Renovating the old building would have cost four-fifths the amount to construct a new building. In contrast to the Chemistry Centre, UBC decided to construct a new law building instead of renovating -- each project is evaluated individually to determine what is best environmentally, economically and socially. The Faculty of Law outgrew the old building so now they will enjoy state-of-the-art teaching and research spaces that promote legal discussions and student engagement.</Description>

   <Description>Creating energy from carbon neutral sources is critical to ensure environmental sustainability. UBC will use wood waste from Vancouver and turn it into synthetic gas to run a generator that will provide enough steam to heat 25% of the campus or sufficient electricity to power the 1,600 bed Marine Drive Student Residence. This generator will be housed inside the first Cross Laminated Timber building in North America.</Description>
